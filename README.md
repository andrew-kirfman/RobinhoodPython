This is going to be an attempt at creating python functions as wrappers to the Robinhood API found here:
  - https://github.com/sanko/Robinhood

Instead of having to deal with curl commands, I'd rather set it up so that you can call simple functions with easy to understand arguments.  

Future work if I have time:
  - Creating a basic web interface to allow trading at the click of a button.  
    * Would like to allow saving trade history.  Potentially scrape history from email?  Could store as flat file, but there are risks
      inherrent in storing everything in one file that could get deleted.  
    * Keep adding things as I think about them!
